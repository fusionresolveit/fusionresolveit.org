FusionResolveIT has been presented to the world the April 21, 2025, in the **FUSIONCON2025** event.

It's a software / tool will help to manage your IT service.

The website has launched, the [github](https://github.com/fusionresolveit/) repositories are now public.

I am (David Durieux) very happy to announce and present this project and to create a community around this free software.

All resources are on the website (directly or with links): development repositories, presentation slides, contact us (discord server)...

Welcome <strong>FusionResolveIT!</strong>
