I am very pleased to announce the release of the first BETA version of FusionResolveIT 1.0.0.

**NOTE: This version is not for production use.**

This *BETA* version is used to test various parts in order to get initial feedback on design issues or features.

Information and the installation/migration procedure are available on [the documentation site](https://documentation.fusionresolveit.org/administrators/).

For any problems, please create an issue [on GitHub](https://github.com/fusionresolveit/Issues/issues).
If you have any comments, please try to propose a solution if possible.

Here's the list of things to test:

* the general design of the application (layout, colors, etc.)
* the SSO section, tested with Keycloak but not with others (e.g., Azure, etc.)
* tickets (creation, ticket lifecycle, closing)
* menu bookmarks
* menu layout; does the layout seem easy to navigate?
* knowledge base articles + visualization on the home page
* the FusionInventory inventory, with this [documentation](https://documentation.fusionresolveit.org/End-user%20guide/fusioninventory/). Focus only on:
   * the operating system
   * the CPU
   * the memory
   * the software
* migration from GSIT or GLPI 9.5.x ONLY (not versions 9.4 and earlier, not 10.x)
* entities and profiles

To download it, go in [release part of github](https://github.com/fusionresolveit/FusionResolveIT/releases/tag/1.0.0-beta.1).

Thank you all for the invaluable help you will provide by testing \o/
